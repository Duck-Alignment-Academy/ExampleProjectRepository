# ExampleProject

The ExampleProject is an example open source project repository to show the basics of what you should have in place before you start trying to build your community.
It's not a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for starting and running an open source project.
Instead, it's a set of short and sometimes silly examples just to give you an idea of what to cover.
If you want more depth on the topic, you can read the posts at [Duck Alignment Academy](https://duckalignment.academy), [_Program Management for Open Source Projects_](https://pragprog.com/titles/bcosp/program-management-for-open-source-projects/), or any number of other books, websites, et cetera.

ExampleProject is for you if you're familiar with how open source projects work, but you're not sure what basic you need to put in place.

## Build instructions

There's nothing to build, but if there were, I'd tell you about it here.

## Project communication

This isn't really like...an ongoing project, so there's not a lot to chat about.
If you see any issues or have suggestions, [file an issue](https://github.com/Duck-Alignment-Academy/ExampleProjectRepository/issues/new/choose).

See [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) for more information about project governance.
