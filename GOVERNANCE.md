# ExampleProject governance

## Leadership committee

The ExampleProject is governed by a leadership committee consisting of the project leader and four committee members.
Members of this committee are elected every May by Ben Cotton because this is his project.
The project leader is selected by unanimous vote of the leadership committee.

Current members of the leadership committee are:

* **Project Leader**: Ben Cotton
* **Committee Member**: Ben Cotton
* **Committee Member**: Ben Cotton
* **Committee Member**: Ben Cotton
* **Committee Member**: Ben Cotton

### Voting policy

The leadership committee votes on all proposals with a +1/0/-1 system.
Most votes require a simple majority to pass, but policy changes require a full consensus.

## Commit access

Contributors can request commit access when they have been active project members for at least one month.
The leadership committee and all existing committers vote privately, with a simple majority decision.
Commit access may be removed for inactivty or misconduct with the private vote of at least 2/3 of leadership committee members and existing committers.

## Community input

Members of the ExampleProject community and the general public are welcome to comment on proposals in GitHub issues prior to the conclusion of a vote.
Once the vote has concluded, we move on with life.
